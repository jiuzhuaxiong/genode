In order to build the kernel adjust the the GENODE_DIR in etc/build.conf to 
your setup.

'make config' will use the HelenOS configuration tool to configure the kernel 
settings, saving the settings in the build directory.
Loading the preconfigured defaults does not work yet. All options have to be 
set manually.
As compiler option use the gcc_native option in order to use the Genode 
toolchain.

'make kernel' will build the kernel into the build directory. For this is work 
in progress it does not build yet.
