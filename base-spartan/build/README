In order to build the kernel adjust the the GENODE_DIR in etc/build.conf to 
your setup.

A simple 'make' will do all the work for you from build all neede sources to 
starting qemu with the generated image in place.
The thereby carried out single action (which can also be executed alone) are:
- 'make config' will use the HelenOS configuration tool to configure the kernel 
settings, saving the settings in the build directory.
As compiler option use the gcc_native option in order to use the Genode 
toolchain.
- 'make kernel' will build the kernel and create all needed symlinks in the 
userspace directory of HelenOS (needed for several includes).
- 'make hello_test' will build a testing root task replacement printing some 
text to the serial port.
- 'make iso' will build an iso image from the given environment and execute 
qemu with it.
