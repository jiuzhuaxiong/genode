/*
 * \brief  Spartan-specific dispatcher class managing incomming ipc calls
 * \author Tobias BÃ¶rtitz
 * \date   2012-08-14
 *
 * This class is ment to have exclusive access to the task specific
 *  answerbox. To be able to deliver the incoming calls to their
 *  destined thread, the thread has to register it's UTCB with the
 *  manager. Incoming calls are automatically stored in the thread
 *  specific call queue, located in the UTCB. Incoming calls which
 *  can not be delivered are answered with an errorcode.
 * As soon as the first worker thread is waiting for incomming calls
 *  the manager thread is beeing started.
 * One task may only have one Ipc_manager thread.
