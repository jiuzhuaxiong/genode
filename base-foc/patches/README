The patches in this directory are modifications of the Fiasco.OC kernel
required for using this kernel with Genode.

:'foc_single_step_x86.patch':

  This patch enables the user land to use the CPU's single stepping mode on
  x86_32 platforms. It is needed to enable the use of GDB monitor for
  user-level debugging.

:'fix_exception_ip.patch':

  On the occurrence of undefined-instruction exceptions on ARM, Fiasco.OC
  reports a wrong program-counter value to the exception handler. The patch
  fixes the problem.

:'jdb_kobject_names.patch':

  This patch increases the size of the JDB kernel object names buffer. The
  original size was too small for some Genode scenarios and caused missing
  thread names in the kernel debugger thread list.
