                      =================================
                      Genode Operating System Framework
                      =================================


This is the source tree of the reference implementation of the Genode OS
architecture. For a general overview about the architecture, please refer to
the project's official website:

:Official project website for the Genode OS Framework:

  [http://genode.org/documentation/general-overview]

The current implementation can be compiled for 8 different kernels: Linux,
L4ka::Pistachio, L4/Fiasco, OKL4, NOVA, Fiasco.OC, Codezero, and a custom
kernel for the MicroBlaze architecture. Whereas the Linux version serves us as
development vehicle and enables us to rapidly develop the generic parts of the
system, the actual target platforms of the framework are microkernels. There
is no "perfect" microkernel - and neither should there be one. If a microkernel
pretended to be fit for all use cases, it wouldn't be "micro". Hence, all
microkernels differ in terms of their respective features, complexity, and
supported hardware architectures.

Genode allows the use of each of the kernels listed above with a rich set of
device drivers, protocol stacks, libraries, and applications in a uniform way.
For developers, the framework provides an easy way to target multiple different
kernels instead of tying the development to a particular kernel technology. For
kernel developers, Genode contributes advanced workloads, stress-testing their
kernel, and enabling a variety of application use cases that would not be
possible otherwise. For users and system integrators, it enables the choice of
the kernel that fits best with the requirements at hand for the particular
usage scenario.


Directory overview
##################

The Genode source tree is composed of the following subdirectories:

:'doc':

  This directory contains general documentation. Please consider the following
  document for a quick guide to get started with the framework:

  ! doc/getting_started.txt

  If you are curious about the ready-to-use components that come with the
  framework, please review the components overview:

  ! doc/components.txt

:'base':

  This directory contains the source-code repository of the fundamental
  frameworks and interfaces of Genode. Furthermore, it contains the generic
  parts of core.

:'os':

  This directory contains the non-base OS components such as the init process,
  device drivers, and basic system services.

:'demo':

  This directory contains the source-code repository of various services and
  applications that we use for demonstration purposes. For example, a graphical
  application launcher called Launchpad and the Scout tutorial browser.

:'base-<platform>':
  These directories contain platform-specific source-code repositories
  complementing the 'base' repository. The following platforms are supported:

  :'linux':
    Linux kernel (both x86_32 and x86_64)

  :'pistachio':
    L4ka::Pistachio kernel developed at University of Karlsruhe.
    See [http://genode.org/community/wiki/GenodeOnL4kaPistachio]

  :'fiasco':
    L4/Fiasco kernel developed at University of Technology Dresden.
    See [http://genode.org/community/wiki/GenodeOnL4Fiasco]

  :'foc':
    Fiasco.OC is a modernized version of the Fiasco microkernel with a
    completely revised kernel interface fostering capability-based
    security. It is not compatible with L4/Fiasco.
    See [http://genode.org/community/wiki/GenodeOnFiascoOC]

  :'okl4':
    OKL4 kernel (x86_32 and ARM) developed at Open-Kernel-Labs.
    See [http://genode.org/community/wiki/GenodeOnOKL4]

  :'nova':
    NOVA hypervisor developed at University of Technology Dresden
    See [http://genode.org/community/wiki/GenodeOnNOVA]

  :'codezero':
    Codezero microkernel developed by B-Labs
    See [http://genode.org/community/wiki/GenodeOnCodezero]

  :'mb':
    Support for running Genode natively on the MicroBlaze softcore CPU.
    See [http://genode.org/community/wiki/GenodeOnMicroBlaze]

  :'host':
    Pseudo platform documenting the interface between the generic and
    platform-specific parts of the base framework. This is not a functional
    base platform.

:'tool':

  Source-code management tools and scripts. Please refer to the README file
  contained in the directory.

:'hello_tutorial':

  Tutorial for creating a simple client-server scenario with Genode. This
  repository includes documentation and the complete source code.

:'libports':

  This source-code repository contains ports of popular open-source libraries
  to Genode, most importantly the C library. The repository contains no
  upstream source code but means to download the code and adapt it to Genode.
  For instructions about how to use this mechanism, please consult the README
  file at the top level of the repository.

:'dde_linux':

  This source-code repository contains the device driver environment for
  executing Linux device drivers natively on Genode. Currently, this
  repository hosts the USB stack.

:'linux_drivers':

  Deprecated version of the Linux device driver environment featuring audio
  drivers and the Intel GEM driver. This repository is in a transitionary
  phase. Its functionality will be incorporated into 'dde_linux'.

:'dde_ipxe':

  This source-code repository contains the device driver environment for
  executing drivers of the iPXE project.

:'qt4':

  This source-code repository contains the Genode version of Qt4 framework.
  Please find more information about using Qt4 with Genode in the repository's
  'README' file.

:'ports':

  This source-code repository hosts ports of 3rd-party applications to
  Genode. The repository does not contain upstream source code but provides
  a mechanism for downloading the official source distributions and adapt
  them to the Genode environment. The used mechanism is roughly the same
  as used for the 'libports' repository. Please consult 'libports/README'
  for further information.

:'ports-<platform>':

  These platform-specific source-code repositories contain software that
  capitalizes special features of the respective kernel platform. I.e.,
  for the OKL4 base platform, a port of OKLinux is provided in 'ports-okl4'.
  For the Fiasco.OC platform, 'ports-foc' hosts a port of the L4Linux
  kernel. For further information, please refer to the README file at the
  top level of the respective repository.

:'gems':

  This source-code repository contains Genode applications that use
  both native Genode interfaces as well as features of other high-level
  repositories, in particular shared libraries provided by 'libports'.
